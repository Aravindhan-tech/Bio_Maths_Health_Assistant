# 👋 Welcome to BioMaths Health Assistant

Hey there! 🚀
This is **BioMaths Health Assistant**, a project where **Biology, Mathematics, and Technology shake hands** to make health analysis easier, smarter, and way more fun to learn.

It’s not just a website or a Python script — it’s a **complete learning + health assistant package** 🎒📊

---

## 🌟 What’s this all about?

Imagine this:

* You type in your **weight, height, blood pressure, or lab values** 🧪
* Our system instantly applies **math + biology formulas** 📐
* And gives you **results you can understand** without being a doctor! 👩‍⚕️👨‍⚕️

This project makes **health data** feel less scary and more **interactive** ✨

**Who is this for?**

* 🏫 **School/College Students** → Great for competitions, science fairs, or projects
* 📚 **Teachers** → Show students how **math applies in biology**
* 👨‍💻 **Developers** → Learn how to integrate **frontend + backend + formulas**
* 🌍 **Everyone Curious** → Basic health awareness in digital form

---

## 🛠️ What’s inside?

We built this in **layers**, like a cake 🎂:

1. **🍪 Basic Website (HTML + CSS + JS)**

   * Clean & simple UI
   * Pages for Core, Anthropometrics, Vitals, and Labs
   * Easy to open in any browser

2. **🍫 Pro Website (React + Vite + TailwindCSS)**

   * Fast, modern, responsive
   * Component-based code (easy to scale)
   * TypeScript for fewer bugs
   * TailwindCSS for clean styling

3. **🧠 Python Script (biomaths\_assistant.py)**

   * The "math brain" of this project
   * Calculates BMI, WHR, MAP, BSA, etc.
   * Can be extended to add AI or ML later

4. **📑 Docs & PPTs**

   * Handy for presenting in **classrooms or competitions**
   * Easy explanation of concepts

## ⚡ Cool Features

* ✅ Input any **Core / Vitals / Anthropometrics / Labs** data
* ✅ Automatic **health formula calculations**
* ✅ **Dual Interface** → simple (HTML) or advanced (React)
* ✅ **Math + Health = Learning by doing**
* ✅ Easy enough for **students**, powerful enough for **hackathons**
* ✅ Ready to extend with **AI, ML, or databases**

## 📊 Health Formulas Inside

🧮 **Some examples of formulas this project knows:**

* **BMI (Body Mass Index):** `BMI = weight (kg) / height² (m²)`
* **BSA (Body Surface Area):** `BSA = sqrt((height × weight) / 3600)`
* **WHR (Waist-Hip Ratio):** `WHR = waist / hip`
* **Pulse Pressure (PP):** `PP = Systolic – Diastolic`
* **Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP):** `(SBP + 2 × DBP) / 3`
* **Growth trends** → using mean, variance, correlation

*(More formulas can be added as the project grows 🔮)*

## 🚀 How to Run It

👉 **Basic Site (HTML/CSS/JS):**

```bash
cd website/Patient web
open index.html
```

👉 **Pro Site (React + Tailwind):**

```bash
cd website/Patient pro web
npm install
npm run dev
```

👉 **Python Script (Health Formulas):**

```bash
cd Python
python biomaths_assistant.py
```

## 🔮 What’s Next?

This is just **Phase 1** 🚦
Planned upgrades:

* 🤖 AI predictions (disease risk, future health trends)
* 📊 Graphs & dashboards with charts
* 🗄️ Database storage (MongoDB / Firebase)
* 📱 Mobile app (PWA or React Native)
* ☁️ Cloud hosting (AWS / Vercel / Netlify)
* ⌚ Wearable device integration (IoT sensors, smartwatches)
